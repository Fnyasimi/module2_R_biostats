#1) plot a heatmap for the bottom 100 expressed genes in euploid shoots on chr1A
# is the pattern similar to for the top 100 expressed genes?

#2) plot a heatmap for both roots and shoots for chr1A, 
# use the top 100 expressed genes in euploid shoots
# add a dendrogram for the columns. You will need to make the columns re-order using colv
# which samples are more related?

#3) CHALLENGE plot the heatmap from #2) using the "aheatmap" function in NMF
# can you add on an annotation column showing which samples are roots, and which are shoots?
# HINT: you will need to make an annotation dataframe and pass it to annCol
# http://nmf.r-forge.r-project.org/vignettes/heatmaps.pdf part 1.4 shows an example
